# To Do
Let's step up the dynamic answer with element from Dialogflow's request: entities and parameter extraction.

# Tips
Dialogflow's recognised parameter is present in the request but be careful, it is NOT required for this intent.   
Definitions are present in `00-ressources/definitions.js`, but it does not contain all possible cases (on purpose).

Lost connection? Debug using intent `_ping`.

Reminder of intent activation:
- Launch Ngrok and local serveur
- Activate fulfillment in Dialogflow interface Dialogflow
- Connect Dialogflow to local serveur
- Verify connexion
